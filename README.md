### Hi there 👋
Since childhood, I harbored a steadfast determination to pursue a career in CS. Planning meticulously and staying motivated have been integral to my journey. My love for C++ grew into a deep passion for coding in ninth grade, igniting my dream of becoming a CS engineer. Coding guides me through challenges, whether I'm tackling CodeChef problems or taking coffee breaks - I admit, I'm a coffee addict. Through my work as a web developer, specifically in crafting visually appealing UIs and enhancing user experiences, my passion for software engineering grew stronger. While I find myself drawn to competitive coding and frontend development, my sights are set on the horizon of becoming a Software Development Engineer (SDE).
