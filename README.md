### Hello Y'all 👋
Since my earliest memories, I've been nurturing an unwavering commitment to carving out a path in the realm of computer science. Guided by meticulous planning and an unyielding drive, I've charted my course with tenacity. My affinity for C++ blossomed into a profound passion for coding during my formative years, igniting the flames of ambition to thrive as a CS engineer. Coding has become not just a skill, but a trusted companion, accompanying me through the rigors of solving CodeChef puzzles and fueling my caffeine-infused brainstorming sessions. As a web developer, specializing in crafting captivating user interfaces and enriching digital experiences, my devotion to software engineering has only deepened. While my interests span competitive coding and frontend development, my sights are set on the grand vista of ascending to the coveted role of Software Development Engineer (SDE).
